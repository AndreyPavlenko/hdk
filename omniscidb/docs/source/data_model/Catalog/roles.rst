The Roleâ€™s data is stored in the ``mapd_roles`` table. There are two levels of roles in Omnisci DB: ``UserRole`` and ``Role``. The two roles are used in permissions. ``UserRole`` is created when a new User is created whereas Role is created when an actual Role is created. ``mapd_roles`` table has roles to users mapping. Multiple roles can be granted to one role or user. If a role is created without being granted to a user then that role lives in `granteeMap_` and `mapd_object_permissions` table.
